                    <p>Admin portals heavily rely on tables due to their capacity to store a large amount of data. The design process of these tables, along with associated elements like page tabs and action buttons, is complex due to limited screen space and diverse user requirements.</p>

            <p>The search bar was used to search for specific orders or transactions. However, the initial design proved unfriendly to users because it led them to click through every tab in order to find their desired item.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Closing thoughts</h2>
            <p>The key challenges in designing the Transactions module were to gather requirements from stakeholders, then formulating and simplifying the complex process into bite-sized tasks for users' easy comprehension and usage.</p>
            <p>While designed as an internal tool, the lessons learnt from its development are still universally applicable. These design strategies can be revisited when designing websites or platforms that requires the use of tables for data management.</p>
