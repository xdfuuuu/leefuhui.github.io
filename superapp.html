Gaining a thorough understanding of the typical steps such homeowners go through when designing their home was crucial. This was done in order to identify areas in which the app could assist to improve and streamline the existing process.

            <p>The vision and direction of the Product Owner was to make use of 3D and AR technology, wherever possible, to ease design processes such that even non-designers will be able to design their own homes.
            </p>
            <p>With that in mind, coupled with the many goals the app aims to achieve, the first step was to divide it into manageable sections for better focus. Corresponding to the general user journey, these sections are split up as such:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design and renovation tips</li>
                <li>Services</li>
                <li>E-commerce</li>
                <li>Projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Information architecture was then created and validated with the product owner and stakeholders.

                    <p>After formulating the information architecture, prioritisation of functions and how they relate to one another was then brainstormed and thought out through flow charts / mind maps.</p>

                    <p>For instance, the general structure began with the first step of the user journey - Finding Designs. As such, the Design module (+ 3D / AR functions) forms the starting piece. From there, other modules such as Services, Marketplace then branch out and interconnect with one another. Using such logic, the entire appâ€™s skeletal structure was developed.</p>
                        
                    <p>Once the general structure is done up and aligned with business goals, wireframe and detailed flows follow.</p>

            <p>Given the numerous interlinked modules to develop for this super-app, compromises had to be made. It is with much regret that there was often a trade-off between the number of functions to develop versus the time available for user testing.</p>

            <p>To save time, many user tests were done internally, that is, with team members, and some may not fall within the appâ€™s target users. While we could get feedback on the general user behaviour and fix glaring issues, if I were given another chance to start from scratch, I would request to spend some money and more time to get proper target users to give the app a try.</p>
